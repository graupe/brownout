brownout - simplistic screen color shifter
============================
brownout is an approach to adjust monitor color temperature.


Requirements
------------
In order to build brownout you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install brownout (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running brownout
-----------

Easing the reducing brightness of attached displays to 60 percent:

   ./brownout 60

Setting the screen colors back to normal:

   ./brownout 100

Decreasing the current level by 5 percent:

   ./brownout -5

Increasing the current level by 12 percent:

   ./brownout +12

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
