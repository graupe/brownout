brownout - simplistic screen color shifter
============================
brownout is intended to adjust the color temperature of the screen. It is a 
direct adaptation of Ted Unangst blog post [0], which also explains the 
motivation behind it. The basic xrandr tool is not able to achieve the desired 
result and alternative programs are bloated compared to the given solution. The 
term "temperature" is used only loosely, since the colors will be bent to the
users preference, not to any proper temperature scale.

Requirements
------------
In order to build brownout you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (brownout is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install brownout (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running brownout
-----------

Adjusting the color of attached displays to 42 percent of the curve:

   ./brownout 42

Setting the screen colors back to normal:

   ./brownout 0

Decreasing the current level by 5 percent:

   ./brownout -5

Increasing the current level by 13 percent:

   ./brownout +13

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of brownout is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
